## Getting Started

First, let’s make sure that your development environment is ready.

- If you don’t have **Node.js** installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/).

Then configure your development environment from the `.env.example` file and install the dependencies from your project’s `package.json` file by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

Finally, after installing the dependencies, the `start` script starts your React "development server" on port 3000.

```
npm start
```

That’s it! :rocket:
